# Making an API II - Inserting Data

In [API part I](ReadMe-API-1-index-show.md) we looked at how to query the data via
an API in the Index and Show methods.

The Index is NOT paginated (a problem for a later step), so we retrieve
ALL the records (even if we had 1,000,000 of them)!

# Author API - Create a New Author

As we have employed Resourceful Routing, we do not need to create a
specific route. :smile:

Our exising `routes/api.php` file has this:

```php
Route::resource('authors', \App\Http\Controllers\API\AuthorAPIController::class);
```

You can also use the following:

```php
Route::resource('authors', AuthorAPIController::class);
```

This means we can now concentrate on the `API/AuthorAPIController.php` 
file and the `store`method.

## Store API Method

Let's start by creating the required API call for the
`http://DOMAIN/api/authors` endpoint.

| Request                   | HTTP Verb | Response                                               |
| ------------------------- |:---------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| http://DOMAIN/api/authors |   POST    | request result code (201), message and author as JSON  |

We want our method to do the following:

- Validate the author data
- Store the new author
- Return a JSON response with:
    - A message - something to send to the caller that may be displayed as
      a message to the user
    - The list of authors
    - Response code of `201, Created`

### Validate Submitted Data

To perform validation in the best way we need to make use of a Store Request.
The Requests are kept in the `app/Http/Requests` folder.

To create the Request Stub we use the command:

```shell
sail artisan make:request StoreAuthorAPIRequest
```

We now edit the `StoreAuthorAPIRequest.php` file and make the following
modifications...

At the top of the file, add the two extra lines to import HTTP Response
Exceptions and the Validator contract:

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\FormRequest;
use Illuminate\Http\Exceptions\HttpResponseException;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Validator;
```


### Allowing the Request

We are currently not checking to see if the user is logged in so change
the `authorized` method to return `true`.

```php
public function authorize()
{
    return true;
}
```

### Validation Rules

Now we need to create the rules for the validation method:

| Field        | Rules                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Given Name   | max 64 chars                               |
| Family Name  | required without given name, max 128 chars |

To define a maximum length we use `max:LENGTH`.

To define something as required when another field is missing, we use:
`required_without:FIELD_NAME`.

Replace LENGTH with a number, and FIELD_NAME with the field that may be blank.

```php
return [
    'given_name' => [
        'max:64',
    ],
    'family_name' => [
        'required_without:given_name',
        'max:128',
    ],
    'is_company' => [
        'boolean',
    ]
];
```

#### Response Structure

Responses should have a common structure, be they successful or not.

A reasonable structure could be:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "MESSAGE TEXT",
    "data": [ { } ]
}
```

- `success` will be a yes or no (aka true and false) situation. So
  we return true or false.
- `message` will be some text to give immediate feedback to the caller. 
  This could be further presented to the end user if appropriate.
- `data` will contain an array of any returned data, be that data 
  from queries or error messages, or similar.

### Failed Validation Response

Because we want to send back a JSON response it is a good idea to 
structure our response to failed validation in a manner that is usable.

We do this by adding the `failedValidation` method.

```php
public function failedValidation(Validator $validator)
{
    throw new HttpResponseException(response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Validation errors',
        'data' => $validator->errors()
    ]));
}
```

### Response Messages

To customise the response messages from the validator we add a `messages` method:

```php
public function messages()
{
    return [
        'family_name.required_without' => 'A family name is required. This is also used for Corporate authors',
        'is_company' => 'Company must be set to True or False',
    ];
}
```

## AuthorAPIController updates

Now we have the Response set up we modify the `AuthorAPIController` a little.

Edit the `AuthorAPIController` and change the store signature to:


```php
public function store(StoreAuthorAPIRequest $request)
```

Next we can add the author to the database.

Edit the `AuthorAPIController` and add the following to the store method:

```php
$validated = $request->validated();                       // Get validated data
$validated['is_company'] = $validated['is_company'] ?? 0; // Default to false
$author = Author::create($validated);                     // Create the author

return response()->json(
    [
        'success' => true,
        'message' => "Created successfully.",
        'data' => [
            'authors' => $author,
        ],
    ],
    200
);
```

## Testing with Postman

Because we are sending data to the API we cannot use the brute force
check via the browser.

We need to use Postman to do the testing. In this test we are not using
authenticated access. 

A suitable postman request could be as shown below:

![Postman Create Author request image](_docs/postman-create-1.png)

The second image shows a corporate author being added:

![Postman Create Corporate Author request image](_docs/postman-create-3.png)

The resulting response from the request is:

![Postman create corporate author response](_docs/postman-create-2.png)

If an incorrect request is made, for instance no values are sent then
we get suitable errors.

Requests with missing data:

![Postman create author with errors request](_docs/postman-create-4.png)

![Request response with errors](_docs/postman-create-6.png)

Responses with errors:

![Request response with errors](_docs/postman-create-5.png)

## Exercises

Complete each of these exercises:

### TODO: Create the Books API create endpoint

- Add the `create` method to `BooksAPIController.php`.
- Make sure you verify all the required data is submitted.
- If the data is not submitted, it will return HTML for the time being,
  this is ok, until we look at error responses in a later stage.
- Store the new book in the database.

### TODO: Test the create method

- Create a suitable test in Postman to verify that you create a record
  using the API only.
- Create a test to check that missing data provides the expected error
  messages in response.

### TODO: Add the Book-Author relationship

- Update the book create API endpoint so that when a book is added,
  its author is linked via the author-book model.
- The Author is passed as TWO text fields (family name(s) or corporate name, and an optional, null if omitted, given name(s)).
- Use these two fields to check if the author exists (if so use that id)
- If not create the author first, then use the new author's ID as the id.
- Refer to the seeders for help on this one.

### TODO: Test the updated create method

- Create a suitable test in Postman to verify that you create a 
  record (and link the associated author) using the API only.

### TODO: Add multiple authors to a book

- When submitting the author details, allow for an 'array of authors' (with family name(s) or corporate name, and an 
  optional, null if omitted,  given name(s) for each author)
- Use this to add multiple authors, in a similar way to the previous problem.


### TODO: Update Author Create Request

Four improvements to be done with the author's create request:

- Update the author create so that if the author already exists then
  the author is returned.
- Ensure a suitable error message is given.
- Provide a suitable response code of 202 to represent the author was
  accepted but not created.
- If the author's given name is provided, and the family name is
  missing, move the given name into the family name.
