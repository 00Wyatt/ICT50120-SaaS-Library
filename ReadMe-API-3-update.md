# Author API - Update an Author

Updating an author is very similar to creating an author. The main
steps in the process are:

- retrieve author 
- patch the author data
- save the changes
- report back updated author and success

There are other parts we have not included, but will implement them as we get to the relevant point.

# Update Author API Request

Let's start with the `UpdateAuthorAPIRequest` as it is very similar to the Store version.

To create the request stub we use the command:

```shell
sail artisan make:request UpdateAuthorAPIRequest
```

The code for the Update request is identical (for the time
being) to the Store.

Copy the code over from one to the other, as needed.

## Update Method

Next we can hit the update method in the AuthorAPIController.

This method will do the following:

- validate data being used for update
- attempt to retrieve the author
- set up default response JSON
- if the author exists, then:
  - update the changed parts of the author
  - save the changes
  - update the response JSON
- send the response
